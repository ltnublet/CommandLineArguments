# CommandLineArguments
Library for handling command line argument parsing

## Simple Example
To see an example usage, look at Arguments.Test.Application/Program.cs and Arguments.Test.Application/UserParameters.cs.
The example shows using attributes to automatically set field values, and using manual arguments to perform actions which are only known at runtime.
